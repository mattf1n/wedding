On Saturday, May 3, 2025, we got married at a park near our cottage apartment in Berkeley, California. We've spent the last 5 months in Berkeley, enjoying the beauty of northern California. Our time here has been magical, and we couldn't imagine a more perfect place to officially say 'I do'.

## The love story

In the spring of 2019, Matt---an eager sophomore in college---introduced himself to a cute girl named Caitlyn. Unfortunately, Caitlyn does not remember this. 
*Fortunately*, they soon met again when Caitlyn (noticing Matt working on an assignment in the dining hall) asked if he wanted to be homework partners.
The homework soon ran out, but somehow we couldn't stop spending time together.
By the end of the semester we were best friends, and by the end of the year, we were dating!

Since then, we graduated college together, survived COVID, moved to new cities thrice, fell in love with each others' big families, and got engaged! 
Our families finally met when we celebrated our engagement in October of 2024 in Florida.

## The ceremony

We had our ceremony in the  Berkeley Rose Garden, where we exchanged our vows among the blooming spring roses.

### Excerpt from Caitlyn's vows
> ... It is no surprise that I wanted to marry you. Every day I feel so lucky I found you. You balance out my really loud voice, challenge me every day. You're kind and way more patient than I am. You push me to enjoy the present moment. You make life easier... I love you so much. You are definitely the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.

> On that note, I have a little gift. When you wear this ring, I hope you are reminded of my unconditional love for you. That we are in this together, forever.

### Excerpt from Matt's vows

> ... From the day I met you until now, I have never had too much "Caitlyn time".
> A hundred lifetimes would not be enough Caitlyn time for me, but I guess I'll just have to settle for one.

> You bring color and excitement and joy into my life, and I want to promise you that I will always love and cherish you through all our days.
> Please take this ring and wear it as a reminder of my love for you.
