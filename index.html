<h1 class="title">We got married!</h1>

<p>On Saturday, May 3, 2025, we got married at a park near our cottage
apartment in Berkeley, California. We’ve spent the last 5 months in
Berkeley, enjoying the beauty of northern California. Our time here has
been magical, and we couldn’t imagine a more perfect place to officially
say ‘I do’.</p>
<h2 id="the-love-story">The love story</h2>
<p>In the spring of 2019, Matt—an eager sophomore in college—introduced
himself to a cute girl named Caitlyn. Unfortunately, Caitlyn does not
remember this. <em>Fortunately</em>, they soon met again when Caitlyn
(noticing Matt working on an assignment in the dining hall) asked if he
wanted to be homework partners. The homework soon ran out, but somehow
we couldn’t stop spending time together. By the end of the semester we
were best friends, and by the end of the year, we were dating!</p>

<p>Since then, we graduated college together, survived COVID, moved to
new cities thrice, fell in love with each others’ big families, and got
engaged! Our families finally met when we celebrated our engagement in
October of 2024 in Florida.</p>

<h2 id="the-ceremony">The ceremony</h2>
<p>We had our ceremony in the Berkeley Rose Garden, where we exchanged
our vows among the blooming spring roses.</p>

<h3 id="excerpt-from-caitlyns-vows">Excerpt from Caitlyn’s vows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>… It is no surprise that I wanted to marry you. Every day I feel so
lucky I found you. You balance out my really loud voice, challenge me
every day. You’re kind and way more patient than I am. You push me to
enjoy the present moment. You make life easier… I love you so much. You
are definitely the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On that note, I have a little gift. When you wear this ring, I hope
you are reminded of my unconditional love for you. That we are in this
together, forever.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="excerpt-from-matts-vows">Excerpt from Matt’s vows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>… From the day I met you until now, I have never had too much
“Caitlyn time”. A hundred lifetimes would not be enough Caitlyn time for
me, but I guess I’ll just have to settle for one.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You bring color and excitement and joy into my life, and I want to
promise you that I will always love and cherish you through all our
days. Please take this ring and wear it as a reminder of my love for
you.</p>

<hr />
<p>To our family and friends: Thank you for your love and support. We
are so appreciative to have such a large and loving group of people
cheering us on. You have made us who we are today, and for that we are
overwhelmed with love and gratitude.</p>
<p>We are excited to start this next chapter of our lives, but first:
it’s honeymoon time <span class="emoji" data-emoji="wave">👋</span>
